==========TOP ITEMS==========
1. Gas Turbine Maint Mechanic
    -Change EOH Calculation EVERYWHERE to be 5minutely, not hourly
    -Load Factor revamp
        --Make dynamic (More temp = faster ramprate, faster maint req, change max output, maybe more emissions?) EOH scaling formula
    -Implement normal(no steam inj), wet control curve (same output, steam inj, incr EOH), dry control curve (less output, steam inj, same EOH)

2. GT Maint UI
    -Create UI for Repairs (Finish GenOptionsUI.java)


==========ON DECK ITEMS==========


==========FUTURE IDEAS==========
*Documentation
    -This could be comments at the top of files, but if I go for it, maybe it's better just to make it's own freaking file or something?
*Charting things for you
    -Could design a BasketChartEngine(tm) for use for this?
*Round all numbers
*better Dynamic Load
*Competitors
    -They could be easily enticed to build generation by the missed load mechanic maybe?
*Load Growth
    -Motivated by certain factors 
        +PC's[+competition] capacity vs. normal load 
        +Industry vs. residential (industry attracted by cheap electric prices, residential attracted by industry, economies of scale attract cheap electric feedback loop)
*Transmission
*Interfaces
*New PMs
    -WT
        +Wind Model, time/region/season/temperature based
            -Temp model?
            -Weather events - tied with solar
        +Location information when building?
    -Solar
        +Solar sunlight model
            -Obviously time based to begin with
            -Weather events - This should be tied with wind
        +Location information when building?   
    -ST
        +Probably will be coal only
        +Coal units will need on-site storage
            +implement minimum mandatory onsite storage fines?
    -Battery
    -Hydro
    -LFG
    -IC
    -CC
*Coal Contracts
*Actual UI
*Revamp Building Generator process
    -Building times
    -Permitting Process
*PPAs
*Emissions Charging (Making Steam Inj a real choice in GTs)
*Peaking vs nonpeaking capabilities

==========DONE==========
11/4/2019 - Documented GT Maint Ideas
          - Planned out changes (fixes) & new features for GT Maint          
11/3/2019 - Testing NG Contracts
                -Tested all but if mmBTU exceeds contract
                -Implement Charging for purchase
