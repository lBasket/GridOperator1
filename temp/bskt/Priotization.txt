==========TOP ITEMS==========
1. Gas Turbine Maint Mechanic
    -Implement on GTs
    -Create UI for Repairs (Finish GenOptionsUI.java)


==========ON DECK ITEMS==========


==========FUTURE IDEAS==========
*Charting things for you
    -Could design a BasketChartEngine(tm) for use for this?
*Round all numbers
*better Dynamic Load
*Competitors
    -They could be easily enticed to build generation by the missed load mechanic maybe?
*Load Growth
    -Motivated by certain factors 
        +PC's[+competition] capacity vs. normal load 
        +Industry vs. residential (industry attracted by cheap electric prices, residential attracted by industry, economies of scale attract cheap electric feedback loop)
*Transmission
*Interfaces
*New PMs
    -WT
        +Historic Wind Data, or simple fake wind generator?
        +Location information when building?
    -Solar
        +Solar Insolation; can probably be better modeled
        +Location information when building?   
    -ST
        +Probably will be coal only
        +Coal units will need on-site storage
            +implement minimum mandatory onsite storage fines?
    -Battery
    -Hydro
    -LFG
    -IC
    -CC
*Coal Contracts
*Actual UI
*Revamp Building Generator process
    -Building times
    -Permitting Process
*PPAs

==========DONE==========

11/3/2019 - Testing NG Contracts
                -Tested all but if mmBTU exceeds contract
                -Implement Charging for purchase
